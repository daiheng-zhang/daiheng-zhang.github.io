Welcome!

I am a first-year PhD student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Rutgers Universityâ€“New Brunswick, starting from Spring 2025, under the supervision of [Dr. Zhao Zhang](https://zhaozhang.github.io/). I am currentlt working closely with [Genbio AI](http://genbio.ai/) this summer. Prior to this, I obtained a Master's degree from the NYU Center for Data Science, and two Bachelor's degrees, one in Financial Mathematics from Ohio State University and another in Pharmacy from Zhejiang University, seperately.

Before joining Rutgers, I interned with Dr. Qiang Liu's research group at UT Austin, [MoleculeMind](http://moleculemind.com/), and [ByteDance seed](https://seed.bytedance.com/en/). I was fortunate to collaborate with esteemed mentors, including [Professor Qiang Liu](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~lqiang/) (UT Austin), [Dr. Chengyue Gong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=AscakBgAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) (UT Austin, now at ByteDance), [Dr. Xinyu Hong](https://www.xhong.me/)(MoleculeMind), and [Dr. Zaixiang Zheng](https://zhengzx-nlp.github.io/)(ByteDance). They have been indispensable guides on my journey into research.

I am highly interested in collaborations in deep generative modeling and AI for Science, and I have also been actively learning high-performance computing. If you share a similar interest, please feel free to contact me via email.
